 
		each control-word consists of two lines (starts with a star sign):
       			first line matches anticoincidence signal
       			second line matches coincidence signal
		each line consists of 16 integers, you have to insert "1" for
		the required signal, else insert "0"
	
		a disabled channel means a double row of zeros
		and a disable statement in the module control word !!! 
	
		make sure that always 16 integers follows on each star sign !         
		comments must not be placed into the control-word itself
	
		if you are happy with your choice you have to run "matr.write" on the
		lynxOS shell level ( -> matr.write )
	
		if you want to know what is downloaded in 2365 matrixes you have to
		run "matr.read" on the lynxOS shell level ( -> matr.read )
	
        		the most right hand integer is input-signal  1
        		the      left hand integer is input-signal  16
