Welcome in the arbitrary data getter program!

  $ xb_getarb [SOME_ROOT_SH...FILE] [OPTIONS]
  
This program will read some fields out of a Land02-like TTree and put them in an arbitrary data structure. It's useful to get a glimpse of other detectors, although it's still limited in functionality (development in progress).

===
COMPILE
===

As usual, just type

  $ make xb_trigger_siv

To get the executable. If something goes wrong, check your libraries.

==
OPTIONS
==

	--verbose | -v
		Print some information about the execution to the standard output.
	
	--read-from | -i <file>
		Sets the ONE input file. Really, use the file list instead.
	
	--write-to | -o <file>
		Write the data read in this file.
	
	--fields | -F
		Look for and read these fields, with the following syntax:
			index_field:bytesize,field:bytesize,...
		The "index_field" is the size of the array of the other fields.
		bytsize is always te size of in bytes of the field (should be always 4).
		NOTE: this also means that you can't read two arrays that have different dimensions in oe single go, sorry.
		NOTE: scalar fields are scalars by using the "__scalar:bytesize" index_field

NOTE: this, as with all the programs in here, it's not rock solid and you will stumble into horrible bugs. Please report them to me and I'll try to fix them!
