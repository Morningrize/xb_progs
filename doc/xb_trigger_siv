Welcome to xb_trigger_siv, the trigger condition selector!

  $ xb_trigger_siv [FILEs] [OPTIONS]

This program check the "tpat" field, a bitfield where the triggers associated with every event are stored. The ouput are all the events that MATCH the given condition.
As for now, only data and track_info can be used with this program. They should be enough.

COMPILE

As usual, just type

  $ make xb_trigger_siv

To get the executable. If something goes wrong, check your libraries.

OPTIONS
==

	-v | --verbose
		Print some information about the execution.
	
	--input | -i
		Set the ONE file from where the data are read. Really, use just the unescaped file list instead.
	
	--output | -o
		Set the name of the output file.
	
	--tpat | -T <string>
		Set the condition to be met by the events.
		The syntax is: [^]flags, where ^ is optional and signifies NOT that flag.
			"high level" reaction triggers:
				minb     -- good beam
				frag     -- we have a fragment
				frs      -- the FRS bit is set
				cbsum    -- both halves of the CB fired
				prt      -- it's a proton
				cbpup    -- CB pileup **BROKEN UPSTREAM**
				pix      -- pix detector fired
				ntr      -- it's a neutron
				cbmu     -- it's a muon in the CB
				landc    -- it's a cosmic in LAND
				cbgam    -- it's a gamma in the CB
				dftc     -- cosmic in the proton chamber
				ntfc     -- cosmic in the NTF
				cblrmu   -- a very wide muon in the CB
			"raw" trigger bits:
				Rpnr     -- POS_NOT_ROLU bit is set
				Rpos     -- POS bit is set
				Rlm      -- LAND_MULT bit is set
				Rlc      -- LAND_COSM bit is set
				Rfrw     -- FRWALL bit is set
				Rfrw-d   -- FRWALL_DELay bit is set
				Rpw      -- PWALL bit is set
				Rpw-d    -- PWALL_DELay bit is set
				Rcbo     -- CB_OR bit is set
				Rcbo-d   -- CB_OR_DELay bit is set
				Rcbs     -- CB_SUM bit is set
				Rcbs-d   -- CB_SUM_DELay bit is set
				Rs8      -- S8 bit is set
				Rpix     -- PIX bit is set
				Rntf     -- NTF bit is set
				Rcbstereo-- CB_STEREO bit is set.
		For more detailed infor about the Tpat, read the comments in the head of "xb_tpat.h" or Land02 documentation --in the latter case: may Newton have mercy of your soul.
	
	--do-or | -O
		Instead of looking for all the selected flags, look for any of them.
	
	--stats | -s
		Print a very rudimentary histogram of the "raw" triggers.

NOTE: this, as with all the programs in here, it's not rock solid and you will stumble into horrible bugs. Please report them to me and I'll try to fix them!
