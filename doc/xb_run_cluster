xb_run_cluster:

./xb_run_cluster [FILE] [OPTIONS]

This program runs the clustering and addback (*NO* doppler correction).

COMPILATION:

$ make xb_run_cluster

This program uses the library "gnuplot_i", written by N. Devillard, which should be reachable by your system.
Also, you should edit the Makefile in order to let the program know where the library is.
The library itself can be retrieved from "http://ndevilla.free.fr/gnuplot/":

$ wget ndevilla.free.fr/gnuplot/gnuplot_i-2.11.tar.gz
$ tar -xzvf gnuplot_i-2.11.tar.gz

USAGE:

-i <file_name> : the name of the input file, which should have come out of xb_data_translator or xb_doppc. If it's not specified, the program reads from standard input.

-o <file_name> : the name of the output file. It should have the suffix .cluster.xb, but that's up to the user. If it's not specified, the program writes on the standard output.

-v : verobse output. The program will print statemets about itself. *DO NOT USE* if you're writing on the standard output, as it will corrupt the data.

-n : sets the neighborhood order for the clustering (i.e.: -n 2 looks for neighbours up to order 2)

-d : causes the program to draw the clusters, at interval wait_for (specified with opion -w <seconds>). Obviously, do not use with the standard output...

-w : the time to wait for between the cluster displays.

-c : check(-ish, as yet) the written file, has effect effect only if a file is written.
