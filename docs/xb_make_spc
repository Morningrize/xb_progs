xb_make_spc:

./xb_make_spc [FILES] [OPTIONS]

This program makes a spectrum out of clustered data coming from xb_run_cluster, and allows to manipulate it to some extent.

COMPILATION:

$ make xb_make_spc

This program uses the library "gnuplot_i", written by N. Devillard, which should be reachable by your system.
Also, you should edit the Makefile in order to let the program know where the library is.
The library itself can be retrieved from "http://ndevilla.free.fr/gnuplot/":

$ wget ndevilla.free.fr/gnuplot/gnuplot_i-2.11.tar.gz
$ tar -xzvf gnuplot_i-2.11.tar.gz

USAGE:
-i <file_name> : **DEPRECATED use thedefault arguments instead!** specifies the file name where the clustered data are stored. This argument is optional, if it's not specified the program reads form the standard input.

-o <file_name> : the name of the file where the histogram will be saved. If it's not specified, the standard output is used (and the histogram is not drawn) ***NOT IMPLEMENTED YET***: the program just ignores the option and draws the histogram, without saving it (as a data file).

-b <num_bins> : specifies the number of bins for the histogram. If not specified, the default is 500 channels.

-R <start_from:end_at> : sets the range for the histogram. If no range is specified, the full 0:8000 KeV banana is used.

-v : verbose output, the program prints statements about itself. *DO NOT USE* when writing the histogram to the standard output!

-I : sets the interactive mode: the program displays a prompt that accepts more or less the same options as the launch, albeit without the "-" preceding. I option is not available and E -- exit the program and G -- redo the histogram are added.
It cannot be used with pipes, as it read from standard input.

-s : sets the gnuplot terminal: qt for the screen (the default) and png for an image file.

-l : sets the log scale on the y axis. Default is yes, can be passed no for linear.

-t : sets the title/file name for saving to PNG.

-m : selects event with a specific multiplicity. The default is 0, which means that there is no selection on multiplicity. If a number (unsigned integer) is given, then *ONLY* that multiplicity is selected.

-H <join|compare|subtract> : if more than one input file is specified, do the selected operation with them while hisrogramming.
