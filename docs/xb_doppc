./xb_doppc [TRACK_INFORMATION_FILES] [OPTIONS]

This program performs the doppler correction on a bunch of loaded data.

COMPILATION:

$ make xb_doppc
	NOTE: as it is a tedious task, the program uses OpenMP to parallelize the task.

USAGE:

The program can read and write from/to stdi/o, BUT either the track information or the data can be read from a pipe, **NOT** both at the same time. Probably, what you want to do is read **the data** from the pipe and read **the tracking information** from HDD. In any case, the program is thought to be easy to use in this way.

OPTIONS:

-i <file_name> : read track information from ONE file. If you want to read more then one file, use the default arguments.

-o <file_name> : output file. As usual, it is compressed with bzip2 and, as usual, there aren't any mandatory naming conventions. You may want to choose a name that reflects what's in the file.

-R : pass the **tracking information** through xb_data_translator --this way, they can be read fresh out of the tracker.

-f : fastidious mode: only process the data for which there is track information (saves time).
	NOTE: the default is "try to guess the incoming beta" from the track information for those
	      events that do not have direct track info.

-F : very fastidious mode: only process the data for which there is track information **AND** only one fragment is identified by the tracker. And use the tracked direction of the fragment to perform the doppler correction,

-v : verbose, the program prints statements about itself. Obviously, don't use if you're piping into another program.

-b : specify the beam direction --by giving the BEAM OUT crystal's index.
