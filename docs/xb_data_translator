xb_data_translator: [FILES] [OPTIONS]

Reads a list of root TTrees from the land02 unpacker or the tracker and saves/pipes it into a custom (much more humane) format, to be used in other programs.

COMPILATION:
$ make xb_data_translator
NOTE: this programs requires ROOT libraries, so make sure you have ROOT configured and reachable before compiling/running it.

OPTIONS:
-i <file_name> : the ROOT file that will serve as an input. This file can be either the output file containing of pwa_ntuple the SYNC level of the crystal ball or the same file, passed through the tracker.
This option forces the program to read from only one file, despite any other input.
NOTE: ROOT files generated in any other way than the one mentioned above will cause undocumented behavior -very likely, a crash. 

-o <file_name> : a place to save the output. For clarity, it should end by .xb, but that is not a requirement if you think you can remember what kind of file it is. It will be a bzip2 compressed file (generally, significantly smaller than the original ROOT file).
This option can be omitted, in which case the program will print (uncompressed) data to the standard output.

-v : verbose mode, when specified the program will print some statements relative to its status. *DO NOT* use it when printing to the stdout: it will corrupt the extracted data and will cause all sorts of woes in the programs down the pipe.

-c : check the written file: performs a check on the written file. Of course, it only works when -o <file_name> is specified.

-t: understand the tracker output: the program will understand and handle *only* the tracker output. No further data will be extracted.
