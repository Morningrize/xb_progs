Tue 21 May 09:20:07 CEST 2019: Hey, a logfile in a development folder? How come?
Tue 21 May 09:20:25 CEST 2019: Because there are some comments to be made here, since this should be the arrival of my PhD.
Tue 21 May 09:21:47 CEST 2019: First and foremost: we are not going to be able to fit anything in the region infested by the atomic background. This because everything is so stupidly huge.
Tue 21 May 09:22:46 CEST 2019: Unless some incredibly aggressive weighting is used --as in: logaritmic.
Tue 21 May 09:30:44 CEST 2019: Yup: with the background VERY close to the signal (which at the moment is a simulation of that same background + some shit I'm trying to fit)
Tue 21 May 09:40:14 CEST 2019: Yeah, log weighting it the bkg part becomes less preponderant. And also, it reflects our interesti in it.
Tue 21 May 16:35:30 CEST 2019: Ukei, the thing is working. Just it's clearly freaking out because the fit converges into negative coefficients. Which is a dick.
Tue 21 May 16:47:54 CEST 2019: Maybe this dataset doesn't have the empty target
Tue 21 May 16:49:36 CEST 2019: Nope.
Tue 21 May 18:40:16 CEST 2019: Ok, actually the minimizer(s) find a better minimum than supertrendize. Which is cool. But also not, since the coefficients for the spectra are a) not the ones that are supposed to be and b) not even positive.
Tue 21 May 18:40:53 CEST 2019: This means: tomorrow I have to produce a manual, interactive minimizer, because this fit will NEVER ever converge to a sensible value without a human brain in the mix.
.........................NOTE: this makes it a "machine aided guess" rather than a fit, but we'll have to take it. As for where we'll need to take it, nobody knows yet, but we'll have to.
Mon  3 Jun 11:32:46 CEST 2019: We're back onto this. Refining the hybridizer AND the manual fitter: would be nice to be ready by day after tomorrow.
Tue  4 Jun 15:06:35 CEST 2019: Debugging...........
Tue  4 Jun 15:32:08 CEST 2019: Aaand the manual fitter is ready. That's good.
Wed  5 Jun 14:22:21 CEST 2019: let's try the whole script. Also, with some noise.
Wed  5 Jun 17:09:43 CEST 2019: Success for what it needs to do. Great.
Mon  4 Nov 17:18:17 CET 2019: So, I'm back as the final uZer.
Mon  4 Nov 17:18:33 CET 2019: Changed some things: now the background is just fixed and given. Full stop.
Mon  4 Nov 17:19:11 CET 2019: This evening I'm going to develop a new hybridizer based on the new xb_spcamp, hoping to get something in the higher energy region... but, anyhow, this is cool and is going to work.
Tue  5 Nov 09:43:34 CET 2019: Ok, last bit of tuning before starting production. This ends this week.
Tue  5 Nov 09:44:07 CET 2019: now trying the fastish hybridizer, hoping that it is actually fastish
Tue  5 Nov 09:44:32 CET 2019: Then I must also introduce limits to the parameters --I don't want them to fall under 0
Tue  5 Nov 10:26:29 CET 2019: Ok, also the fastish hybirdizer is too slow. At least on the laptop. Now going for the good ol' fast one.
Tue  5 Nov 12:40:06 CET 2019: bad news: the constrained gradient descent is very much slower
Tue  5 Nov 13:49:47 CET 2019: good news: I found the problem. Bad news: I'm a pillock. Good news: I corrected the problem. Bad news: I can't test it before the meeting.
Tue  5 Nov 15:48:06 CET 2019: Yup, with the limit  installed and working properly, the fatish is fast enough
Wed  6 Nov 10:33:07 CET 2019: So let's add the direct 2+ decay and let's fit again.
Wed  6 Nov 12:50:54 CET 2019: There's going to be some more tuningn I think, BUT with the limited fit and 11 xenergies, it looks pretty interesting.
Wed  6 Nov 12:52:05 CET 2019: A thing I have to do: must save the ordering of the data --> the original filename array. Or have a way to save the energy correspondence.
Wed  6 Nov 12:53:20 CET 2019: I'd like to have a switch to include also the MT target in the fit. Not te big fat atomic, that's too big, but the empty may help me at lower energies.
Wed  6 Nov 12:56:53 CET 2019: Another think I might consider doing, with the fast hybridizer, is to remove the rounding except at drawing...
Wed  6 Nov 13:03:35 CET 2019: I may also want to save a plot of the thing, via gnuplot, when I OK it.
Wed  6 Nov 14:35:12 CET 2019: Testing the last things. But, anyway, for r0 with a fixed MT, the fit converges (the errors are humongous, but I'll deal with that later )
Wed  6 Nov 16:03:13 CET 2019: This is getting stoopid now.
Wed  6 Nov 16:27:43 CET 2019: Ok, seems to be working. Not converging, but working yes --with the MT thingie... now tryng the full fit.
Wed  6 Nov 16:46:43 CET 2019: Last bug to squash, hopefully: the pees setting number. It killed me already twice
Wed  6 Nov 16:46:54 CET 2019: That's it: committing and then this can carry on at home.
Thu  7 Nov 10:06:46 CET 2019: I'm not overwhealmend with the performance of the fitter with the floating MT. Let's go back to the hard one.
Thu  7 Nov 10:07:32 CET 2019: After I tried with the fastish hybridizer (which will be glacially slow)
Thu  7 Nov 10:38:19 CET 2019: Ok, stop faffing: production starts now
Thu  7 Nov 10:38:51 CET 2019: I'm doing various versions for various fit methods. r0_v00 is -F
Thu  7 Nov 12:53:53 CET 2019: sneakily added a chi squared for the fits, so that I have some way to measure how goo (or crappy) they are.
Thu  7 Nov 13:13:24 CET 2019: not so sneakily: how many syntax errors can I do in two fucking lines of code?
Thu  7 Nov 14:13:11 CET 2019: the v00 suffix is shaping to mean '-F'
Thu  7 Nov 14:25:48 CET 2019: must fix the errors on the fit parameters... LATER
Thu  7 Nov 14:26:25 CET 2019: and the chi2 is broken. As unzual.
Thu  7 Nov 15:09:29 CET 2019: Doing the fitting with the fastish. These will be in the v01 files
Thu  7 Nov 15:38:20 CET 2019: This seems clueless with so few counts... shall we try once with an amplified spectrum?
Thu  7 Nov 15:38:37 CET 2019: No, then it converges to the -F algo
Thu  7 Nov 15:39:00 CET 2019: But the error estimation here works. For some reason.
Thu  7 Nov 15:48:59 CET 2019: No, this ain't going anywhere. And it does that slowly.
Thu  7 Nov 16:16:34 CET 2019: Ok then, that's it. I'm off for today, I'll address the hydeousness of the errors tomorrow.
Fri  8 Nov 16:13:28 CET 2019: repeating the whole thing (only in -F) with 4.33 and 4.66 MeV added.
Fri  8 Nov 16:13:42 CET 2019: Errors are still humongous.
Fri  8 Nov 16:27:04 CET 2019: What if I accept these errors (the method is sound) and say: they are the _variance_ of the parameters --> the error on the expected value (the parameter itself) will be the variance OVER the square root of the number of points, 201 in this case?
Fri  8 Nov 16:27:30 CET 2019: They will still be big, BUT at least not ridiculous.
Fri  8 Nov 16:34:09 CET 2019: From r2 this is included. r0 and r1 should be corrected (just keep in mind that you have to divide the errors by sqrt(201) ).
Fri  8 Nov 16:41:37 CET 2019: Done. The pictures are not updated, tho.
Fri  8 Nov 16:55:26 CET 2019: Ok, rest at home/tomorrow. Another nice weekend at the PC.
Sat  9 Nov 11:35:38 CET 2019: warning: chi2 changed again (now it's correct, and will actually be added to the repo). So repeat all realisations. Should NOT take long.
Sat  9 Nov 14:58:46 CET 2019: I'm also redoing the previous three, with an additional b suffix. Then I'm trying one with the fastish hybridizer and data amplification.
Sat  9 Nov 15:34:35 CET 2019: The fastish hy is still useless. Trying to fit with the fast hy results in a 10 fold increase in the chi2 for an amplification of 3.2
Sat  9 Nov 15:38:56 CET 2019: I think that's it folks. On to the spectra.
Sun 10 Nov 11:53:49 CET 2019: Ok, DHAVE the script. It works, I don't remember how to do the RP. Then it's done.
Sun 10 Nov 12:15:36 CET 2019: Seems that that should be it... will look a bit more into it. But it's just a game of scale factors right now.
Sun 10 Nov 18:31:36 CET 2019: Did the graphs. There are some error bars to review (all those of the cross sections and possibly the ones of the data)
Sun 10 Nov 18:32:01 CET 2019: But it's finished, essentially: tomorrow I'm writing the final things.
