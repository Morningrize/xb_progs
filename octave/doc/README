This directory contains the interface to read and write with GNU Octave the data
formats used in the toolkit.

It (obviously) requires GNU Octave and the toolkit, installed and reachable.
In effect, only the library libxb_core.so is used here, so ROOT isn't a strong
requirement.

To compile:
    $ cd [wherever]/xb_progs/octave/
    $ make all -j$( nproc )

To install in GNU Octave, in the xb_progs/octave dir:
    $ octave --no-gui (or use the GUI prompt to type what follows)
    > addpath( [pwd, "/oct/"] );
    > addpath( [pwd, "/msrc/" ); %for the script collection.
    > savepath;

Basic usage documentation is provided via Octave's "help <fn>" command.
For more extensive information about the content of the data structures, please
refer to the documentation of the toolkit, found in xb_progs/doc/.
